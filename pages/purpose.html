            <h1 class="page-title">Our Purpose</h1>
            
              <h3>Welcome to Story Mashups. </h3>

                <p>This app was designed to help younger children (aged 5 - 7 years) learn to write by encouragement and the "want" to write, rather than feeling "forced" to write.</p>

                <p>During lockdown, many children have struggled with their reading and writing. The goal of this app, is to allow children to feel like "they want to" join in and contribute to a story by using short sentences and amusing gifs.</p>

                <p>The children can see the final outcome in Our Stories titled "Story of the Day". The results of the random sentences and gifs can be very amusing to young children.</p>
            
                <p>The feeling of pride and accomplishment of seeing their work published to a full story, will hopefully ignite the spark of reading and writing, and give them the confidence to learn more using pen and paper.

            <h3>How it Works</h3>

                <h4>The Mashup Style:</h4>

                <h6><strong>NB:</strong>The students will ultimately be allowed access to the app via their respective schools and teachers.<br>
                Users will remain anonymous.</h6>

                <p>The starting post can have default sentences to start the children off. This is a future feature to add.</p>
                <ul class="list-group">
                    <li class="list-group-item">The student should be able to see an area to type inside. This is where they will contribute to the story of the day by writing a short sentence. </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">The sentence is limited to 150 characters which will be shown in a counter below the input area.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">The student may also add a gif using the search box to type a word that goes with their sentence.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Just "Add Gif" to add it to the post before submitting it.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">To submit your post, click on the pencil button which says "Add to Story"</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Once submitted, the students will then be able to see the latest posts in which to continue the story.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">For submitted posts the children will be able to leave a comment using the "reply" button, or add a reaction using one of three emojis available.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">At the end of the day, the submitted posts will be joined together to create a "Story of the Day" which can be viewed on the "Our Stories" page; the results of which, can be hilarious, and the children will love it.</li>
                </ul>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h4>Other Variants</h4>
                <p>This game can also be played using the five "w's":<br>
                This involves the children receiving one of the following:</p>
                <ul class="list-group">
                    <li class="list-group-item">Who?</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">What?</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Why?</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Where?</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">When?</li>
                </ul>   
                <p>The children would then have to take this word and continue the story using it.
                    The stories would be complete once they each have five "w" sentences using one of each "W words".
